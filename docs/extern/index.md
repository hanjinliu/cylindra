# Working with Other Softwares

To maximize the power of computational tools, `cylindra` provides several functions to
import and export data from other softwares. These functions are implemented as built-in
plugins using the `cylindra` [plugin system](../plugins.md).

Currently supported softwares are:

- [IMOD](imod.md)
- [RELION](relion.md)

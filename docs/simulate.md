# Simulate Tomograms

`cylindra` implements several methods to simulate tomograms.

## Prepare Molecules of Arbitrary Periodicity


### 1. Cylinder with constant periodicity

### 2. Apply local conformational changes

## Simulate Tomograms from Molecules

1. Define a mapping from a molecules-layer to a density.
2. Calculate projections.
3. Add noise to the projections.
4. Back projection.

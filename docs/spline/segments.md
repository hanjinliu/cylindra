# Annotate Segments on Splines

Splines can be tagged with `SplineSegment` objects to represent segments along the
spline. A `SplineSegment` is defined by a start and end position along the spline, and
a value (e.g., a label or a measurement) associated with that segment.

Segments are designed to facilitate manual annotation along splines. For example, one
can annotate protein-bound regions, conformational states, etc.

# Cylindra

Cylindra is a Python module for image analysis of cylindric structures in cryo-ET.
Spectral analysis, simulation and subtomogram averaging of heterogenic cylindrical
structures are implemented.

### Major Dependencies

These are the major dependencies of `cylindra`. You don't have to fully understand
them, but knowing them will help you to use `cylindra` more efficiently.

??? info "Show list"
    - [numpy](https://numpy.org/): Most of the basic mathmatical operations, such as
      trigonometric functions and vector operations are done with this library.
    - [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/): Some of the advanced functions, such as Fourier
      transformation, 3D rotation and spline fitting are done with this library.
    - [polars](https://pola.rs): A library for tabular data analysis, with beautifully
      designed API.
    - [napari](https://napari.org/): Multi-dimensional image viewer. Many of the
      visualization functions in `cylindra` are based on this library.
    - [magicgui](https://pyapp-kit.github.io/magicgui/): A powerful GUI generator for
      Python. This library "hides" the complexity of GUI programming, making the code
      very clean.
    - [magic-class](https://hanjinliu.github.io/magic-class/): An extension of
      `magicgui` that can convert Python classes into a multi-functional GUI.Multi-threading, macro recording, command palette and undoing are implemented in
      this library.
    - [impy](https://hanjinliu.github.io/impy/): A Python library for image processing.
    - [acryo](https://hanjinliu.github.io/acryo/): A Python library for parallel cryo-ET
      data analysis.
